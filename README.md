Unlocks advanced roles, traps, and special abilities for a higher-stakes game. Includes **Jester, Bodyguard, Hunter, and Electro Wizard**.

### **🟢 STAT GUESS MODE (Clash Wordle)**

## **🎭 Special Roles & Abilities (Chaos Mode)**

| Role | Team | Icon | Special Ability / Twist |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Mr. White** | Impostor | ⬜ | Has **NO** card. Can steal the win by guessing the Civilian word if caught (75% fuzzy match). |
| **Jester** | Neutral | 🃏 | **Win Condition:** Wins the game instantly, alone, if successfully voted out. |
| **Bodyguard** | Civilian | 🛡️ | Assigned one player to protect. If the **target** is eliminated, the Bodyguard is **also** eliminated immediately\! |
| **Hunter** | Civilian | 🤠 | If voted out, they get a **Last Shot** to choose and eliminate one other player with them. |
| **Electro Wizard** | Impostor | ⚡ | During the reveal phase, secretly **ZAPs (silences)** one player for the entire first discussion round. |
| **Mirror Match** | Trait | 🪞 | **(5% Chance)** Two Civilians get the same word and are secretly told of their alliance. |

## **🕹️ How to Play**

### **Social Deduction (Regular/Chaos)**

1. **Setup:** Choose a mode, set player count, and assign roles (must have at least one enemy).  
2. **Pass & Reveal:** Each player secretly sees their identity and word. The Electro Wizard selects a Zap target here.  
3. **Discuss:** Everyone takes turns saying *one word* to describe their card within the **3-minute time limit**. Zapped players remain silent.  
4. **Eliminate & Resolve:** The eliminated player's role is revealed, triggering any special role abilities (Mr. White's Guess, Jester's Win, or Hunter's Shot) and checking for Bodyguard sacrifice.

### **Stat Guess Mode**

1. **Goal:** Guess the randomly selected hidden card.  
2. **Guessing:** Enter a card name and submit.  
3. **Feedback:** Each guess shows 7 stats (Elixir, Rarity, Speed, Hit Speed, Type, Targets, Range):  
   * **Green:** Exact match.  
   * **Yellow:** Close. Elixir within 1, Hit Speed within 0.3s, Rarity or Speed one step away, or a partly matching Type/Targets/Range.  
   * **Red \+ Arrow:** Wrong. The arrow shows whether the hidden card's value is **higher (▲)** or **lower (▼)**.  
4. **Limit:** You have 10 tries.
